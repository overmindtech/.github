# What is Overmind?

Overmind is a powerful tool for real-time impact analysis on Terraform changes. Overmind can **identify the blast radius** and **uncover potential risks** before they harm your infrastructure, allowing anyone to make changes with confidence. We also track the impacts of the changes you make e so that you can be sure that your changes haven't had any unexpected downstream impact.

## Why Use Overmind?

* **☁️ Cloud Complexity:** Terraform tells you what it's going to change, but not whether this change will break everything. Teams need to understand dependencies to properly understand impact.
* **👨‍🏫 Onboarding & Productivity:** Due to the reliance on "tribal knowledge", expert staff are stuck doing approvals rather than productive work and newer staff take longer to become productive.
* **📋 Change Management Process:** IaC and automation mean that changes spend substantially more time in review and approval steps than the change itself actually takes.
* **🔥 Downtime:** Outages are not caused by simple cause-and-effect relationships. More often than not, downtime is a result of dependencies people didn't know existed.
